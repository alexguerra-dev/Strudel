# Strudel

Here is some documentation.

[My Strudel Documentation](doc/strudel.md)
## Things That I Think Sound Good

[Test](doc/test.md)

- [ ] Make a new song templet
- [ ] Make a music metadata snippet for neovim
- [ ] Get prettier to work on the Strudel file

## Working in an *environment*

What does this mean?

I think this basically means that I want to work in my own ide. I want to have snippits

### NeoVim

My configuration.

- Question: How do I copy a line? (you can use `yy`, that is pressing the  letter `y` twice. That will put it on your paste board)
- Question: How do I make a snippet?
- [ ] Document how to use windows and such.
- [ ] How to automatically asign the type of a file?

### Ghostty

I am not sure how to do some tab and window managment yet.
I just got a better... I am not sure what todo? I want to play music and have fun.
Nothing I am doing is going to get me any money.

- [ ] Make a bash alias that runs `tree` but does not look at package.json... Or, whatever is in a gitignore file.

This can be done with the command `tree -I "node_modules"`! Woot! Now I just have to make this into an alias in my zshrc file.
